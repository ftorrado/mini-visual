# MiniVisual

MiniVisual is a simple & tiny library for minimalist data visualization. View your data in a glance, in-line or wherever you fancy.

Heavily inspired by the great ["Warming Stripes" global warming visualization](https://showyourstripes.info/)

## TODO

  - More tests
  - Improve configuration passing
  - Test ways to have some kind of axis legend that keeps the visualizations simple and inline(able)... Maybe like a tooltip?
